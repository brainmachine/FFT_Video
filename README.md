## The conversation
### How the conversation shaped the work
- Symmetry 
- Hidden sector
- Consciousness 

As a group we engaged with a variety of topics, including symmetry, consciousness, magic and the hidden sector. Early on, it became rather evident that we all had a different understanding of words and concepts and finding points of contact between art and physics was one of the more challenging and rewarding parts of the process. 
Early on we discussed ideas of symmetry (and symmetry-breaking) in physics - a concept that is both interesting and relatable to visual thinkers.

## What I have generated for the project (how many pieces)

I'm coming into this project informed by my previous work with particle collision data. 

## Technical requirements and space needed
