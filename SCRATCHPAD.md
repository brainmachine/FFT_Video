        - blending arc: source_only (1 cycle) -> fade to fft (1 cycle) -> fft_only (1 cycle) -> swap video+fft-source and repeat cycle
    - OR composite videos (source: left, fft: right)

- Dual channel:
    - Videos play synchronously on 2 projectors, side-by-side on the same wall
    - Audio is played on 2 channels, speakers mounted on left and right





# Dual channel version
This version would require me to travel to Vancouver and install the work myself. This version requires 2 projector, a relatively powerful computer and a video splitter or a video card with multiple outputs. If you are interested in installing this version of the work I would be happy to travel to Vancouver for the show. I am not submitting any material expenses, perhaps the funds can be reallocated towards my displacement.
